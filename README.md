# Todo Backend

A simple backend server for technical tests in dart. Backed by an in-container sqlite3 database for simplicity

## Running

Simply run `make run` to run the backend. The server will start listening on port `8080`.
You can stop the server at any time with `Ctrl + C` (`SIGINT` signal)
